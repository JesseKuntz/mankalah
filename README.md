# Mankalah AI

The C# code that is included in the 'mankalah' repository allows the user to run and test a custom Mankalah AI against either themselves or another AI. 

## Note

The project can be run with a 'dotnet build && dotnet run' command from the terminal as long as .NET is installed, and works on the Mac OS. It can be edited using Microsoft's Visual Studio Code using the C# extension. It was initialy written using Microsoft's Visual Studio, so in order to run in Windows a .csproj file needs to replace the .json files.
